# contributed-csharp-projects
This is a collection of c# projects, which we made in teams
#### Currency Exchange https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/currencyExchange
* This project is a currency changer application with Entity framework (ORM), my part was to give and handle user roles and access, connect the application with external API, handle bugs, make a chart.js diagram for the site and add some ajax to the project.
#### Flight Finder https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/FlightFinder
* It is a .NET Core Web Application, based on SkyScanner API. As a user you can get valid information about flights by the added criteria. In this project we made the main backend logic and implementation in pear programming, so it is out teams work but we worked on easier user stories alone too. My part was to implement some autocomplite, and fixing bugs.
#### Saint Sender https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/saint-sender-csharp-_underscore
* This is an early WPF e-mail application where you are able to read and send email (gmail login only). My part was to implement the e-mail reading feature (list out inbox and be able to open it).
#### Sanity Archiver https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/sanity-archiver-c-sharp-randomname
* This is our first WPF app, and it is a simple file handler. My part was to implement tree-view and the menu bar.
